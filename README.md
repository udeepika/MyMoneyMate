PROJECT NAME
------------

MyMoneyMate

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------

This is an Android application which helps in keeping a record of personal expenses. 
Using this application the user can create,read,update and delete expenses. 
It allows the user 
to list his/her expenses by category, by date and between 2 dates. 
The expenses can also be viewed
in the form of a pie-chart which is an efficient and colorful way of analyzing one's expenses. 


-Application developed using Android 4.2.2 API level 17. 

-Application uses AChartEngine, a charting library for Android Application.(Apache License 2.0)

-The website for AChartEngine is : http://www.achartengine.org/


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------

- Currently the application allows the user to save only expenses. In future, I would like to extend it
  to save credits or income as well. 
- Each expense consists of a date, category, amount and id field. I also plan to add an image field to the 
  database table to save the image of the receipt or check related to the expense entry.
- Currently the user has to choose dates to view expenses between them. I plan to add a view expenses by month
  option so that by just selecting the month the user can view all the expenses for that month.
- I plan to add viewing the expenses in bar chart format as well.
